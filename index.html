    </ol>

    <h1 class="middle">A guide on how to properly execute /me and /do.</h1>

    <hr>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>There seems to be a lot of confusion and lack of effort from players trying to use /me and /do. This guide will teach you how to properly execute these commands that will help enhance your roleplay.</li>
        <li>What is a /me? - A /me is expression and/or action done by the respected player. Ones /me may contain what they're wearing, mood, tattoos, something they're doing, and so forth. It's exclusively used to describe one's self.</li>
        <li>What is a /do? - A /do is used to truthfully describe an active scenario and it is used to answer roleplay that would've been answered realistically. Due to limitations via script and game, you have to actually roleplay it.</li>
        <li>Here are some examples of an acceptable /me:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>/me Stays aware of surroundings while associates are talking.</li>
            <li>/me Removes all clothing and places them on the bed.</li>
            <li>/me Balls up fist and swings on male.</li>
            <li>/me Takes mask out of pocket and puts it on.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Here are some examples of an unacceptable /me:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>/me SHOWS MALL COP BADGE (Try not to put it in all caps and try to use periods)</li>
            <li>/me Steals off. (Try and go into detail on what you're doing)</li>
            <li>/me Would be annoyed. (This would be a /do not a /me)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Your /me's should have a period at the end of them no matter what. There should be no curse words in your /me and your sentences should be grammatically correct. (ex: Using all capital letters.)</li>
        <li>Here are some examples of an acceptable /do:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>/do Would the male/female be lying? (This is a way to improve RP)</li>
            <li>/do The room would reek of a strange odor. </li>
            <li>/do Would there be any resistance? (This is mainly used by cops.)</li>
            <li>/do Would tap males pockets, what will I find? (Use this when knocking someone out if you would like to rob them)</li>
            <li>/do The male Would find a phone, food, and $200. (This would be a respond to the /do above)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When someone is answering a /do you are not allowed to know that in RP that is powergaming and will result in a ban/kick</li>
        <li>Here are some examples of an unacceptable /do:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>/do Where would I find the gun? (This is blatant Powergaming and can result in a kick/ban.)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>/Me's and /Do's are mandatory. Failure to use them when needed will result in a kick, if you continue to do so, you will be banned for 1 hour minimum</li>
